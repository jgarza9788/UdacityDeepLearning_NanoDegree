# matrics math
```
2 + [[1,2],[3,4]] = [[1+2,2+2],[3+2,4+2]] = [[3,4],[5,6]]
```
add two to each item in the matrix ^

## add matrices

[[1,2],[3,4]] + [[1,2],[3,4]] = [[2,3],[6,8]]

rows * columns
the number of rows need to equal the number of columns.
aka the numbers on the inside need to be the same.

2x3 * 3x2 ✅
2x2 * 3x3 ⭕

order matters in dot products

Important Reminders About Matrix Multiplication
* The number of columns in the left matrix must equal the number of rows in the right matrix.
* The answer matrix always has the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right matrix.
* Order matters. Multiplying A•B is not the same as multiplying B•A.
* Data in the left matrix should be arranged as rows., while data in the right matrix should be arranged as columns.
